Introduction
**************


Overview
===========
ARock is an asynchronous parallel C++ library for solving equations and optimization problems on shared memory systems. The package is based on the `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_ Library for matrix and vector operations. OpenMP is used for parallelization. ARock includes async-parallel implementation of

  * Relaxed Jacobi method for solving linear equations;
  * Newton method for solving nonlinear equations (coming soon...);
  * Operator splitting method for minimizing regularized empirical risk minimization problems (LASSO, logistic regression);
  * Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for consensus and decentralized optimization problems (coming soon...).

  
ARock currently supports C++ interface. Python, Julia and Matlab interfaces are under development.
    

Dependencies
==============
* Functioning C++ compilers (`gcc <https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/releases.html>`_ )
* `GNU make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_
